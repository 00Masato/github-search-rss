(which live in AssetUrlHelper). Those are helpful to know, but less frequently used I think. It's also incomplete (some mention it, others don't, *_tag helpers have their <em>_url/</em>_path counterparts, or use the basic <code class=\"notranslate\">asset_path/url</code>.) I don't think it's worth expanding with all these variants, I'd rather remove the individual ones, and if we want to mention, we can maybe bundle them together within the same subsection instead, or just as examples of the related *_tag sections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The cache helper could use some more info. I don't think it's worth linking to the Fragments API, but rather to the <a href=\"https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching\" rel=\"nofollow\">fragments caching piece of the caching guide</a>, where it goes into more details. The example could also be expanded to show something that at least gets a record as an example too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><code class=\"notranslate\">content_for</code> could perhaps benefit from showing <code class=\"notranslate\">content_for?</code> in the example, somehow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We do not want to show any form helpers here, just link to the specific guide, but we can maybe make that paragraph clearer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><code class=\"notranslate\">escape_javascript</code> could use an example (not the one that's on the API as it seems very jquery-related... maybe some other example of embedding some Ruby in JS or something)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">mention of <code class=\"notranslate\">rails-html-sanitizer</code> could be linked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">\"NB: The output may still contain unescaped '&lt;', '&gt;', '&amp;' characters and confuse browsers.\" should be a note?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">UrlHelper could have a few extra items like <code class=\"notranslate\">current_page?</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">mail_to</code>, which can be commonly used. (no need to show each and every method, just the most common ones)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">CsrfHelper seems unnecessary to explain here. (we don't add CspHelper for instance... not sure we need to get into those, can probably skip them.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We could have a section on <code class=\"notranslate\">TextHelper</code> mentioning things like <code class=\"notranslate\">simple_format</code>, <code class=\"notranslate\">truncate</code>, <code class=\"notranslate\">excerpt</code>, maybe some other(s).

But relying on this is undesirable iin my opinion as it makes the Active Job abstraction leaky, and if in the future you need to migrate to another backend or even just move the queue to a separate database, you may experience a lot of race conditions of the sort.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">But more generally, being able to defer work to after the current transaction has been a missing feature of Active Record. Right now the only way to do it is from a model callback, and this forces moving things in Active Record models that sometimes are better done elsewhere. Even as a self-proclaimed \"service object skeptic\", I often wanted this capability over the last decade, and I'm sure it got asked or desired by many more people.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Also there's some 3rd party gems adding this capability using monkey patches. It's not a reason to upstream the capability, but it's a proof that there is demand for it.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Implementation wise, this proof of concept shows that it's not really hard to implement, even with nested multi-db transactions support.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The one thing I haven't implemented yet, but probably isn't too hard is the Active Job integration. But for that one we probably want to do it with some sort of callback so that we don't introduce a hard dependency on Active Record in Active Job.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">FYI: <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/cristianbica/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/cristianbica\">@cristianbica</a></p>",

For example, one might need to represent a subset of strings as a list in a single attribute; or even an entire group of associated models that are all embedded in a named collection.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This PR aims to implement a new Collection type.<br>\nIt subclasses the base Value class and overrides the necessary methods so casting and serialization work for an array of objects that are themselves valid for one of the types in the Registry. This ensures that each element of the collection can be cast and serialized individually by delegating the operation to the appropriate type instance.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Collection serializes itself as a JSON array on the database. For casting, it attempts to convert values to a Ruby array.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Methods:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">type</code>: returns the :collection symbol.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">serializable?</code>: checks if the given value is an array containing only elements in which are all serializable for the collection type. It will instantiate the type passed during its own initialization and call serializable? for each element.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">serialize</code>: returns a JSON string of an array with all elements serialized by the collection type.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">deserialize</code>: expects a JSON array string and converts it into a Ruby array with each element deserialized by the collection type.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">cast</code>: converts the given array into a normalized collection of cast values. It will map the given array to a new one in which each element is cast into a new value by the collection type.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">changed_in_place?</code>: Accepts raw serialized value, deserializes it and checks if any of the elements of the collections were mutated according to the collection type method of the same name.</li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">assert_valid_value</code>: checks if all elements of the given array are accepted by the collection type method of the same name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Other Information</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This change also introduces additional <code class=\"notranslate\">Value#valid_value?</code> method that is supposed to separate the assertion, which raises an exception from a boolean check that can be reused in other places. This way new types won't have to override the whole <code class=\"notranslate\">assert_valid_value</code> method if they want to keep the default error message.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Let me know if this change should be implemented in a separate PR. I decided to keep it in this PR for better readability of the change but definitely willing to extract it and have a discussion is a different PR. Thanks!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Documentation</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Currently only the class itself is covered with documentation.

To mitigate the long response times, our application has a maximum allowed request time budget, which can be exhausted by multiple types of these issues. We would like to control the application wait time dynamically and gradually reduce that as the web request progresses. It will allow us to prevent a query from exhausting the request time budget.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Detail</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I added the ability to customize the database <code class=\"notranslate\">read_timeout</code> property dynamically.

What I’m hoping for is some sort of runtime policy that says “no ActiveRecord access is allowed in here, you must load everything you need first”</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Here’s another way to put it. If I have some business logic that combines data loading with some kind of pure calculation, it would be nice to have the power, when it is useful, to strongly separate these concerns and be sure the separation remains.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This power could be useful for any situation where a hot code path must remain free of queries. Perhaps it could be used to implement a policy to prevent database access during the render phase of an HTTP request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">N+1 queries can be a real performance concern. It isn't always immediately obvious what the impacts could be of adding a new query. I wish engineers would be constantly watching the query log as they work. But things can get out of hand quickly, and even if you are watching the wall of queries being logged, N+1s can sometimes disappear into the noise.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Also, there are times when I want a pure in-memory algorithm. An API like this would allow me to both express and enforce the intention to not be hitting the database in a branch of code.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Just today, I was working with some code that broke a test that asserts for a given controller action, exactly 118 queries are dispatched. This is a terrible test to have, but we have it because we have had real problems with query explosions emerging unexpectedly. I believe strict loading could help, but it would not have prevented all of the problems that led to write and maintain this test.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This is indeed a heavy hammer to use. But I don't see an alternative that can achieve the same level of assurance, and the implementation was pretty easy thanks to the prior art of <code class=\"notranslate\">while_preventing_writes</code>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Detail</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This Pull Request adds <code class=\"notranslate\">while_preventing_access</code> to the public API of ActiveRecord::Base much like was done for <code class=\"notranslate\">while_preventing_writes</code> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"383302161\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/34505\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/rails/rails/pull/34505/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34505\">#34505</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Additional information</h3>\n\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Checklist</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Before submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:</p>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> This Pull Request is related to one change.
